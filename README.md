# cmpscapstone

This repository is for Zoe Birnbaum, Gabby Reese, Cece Haase, and Daniel Cicero's senior capstone project at Tulane. We are creating a data dashboard for The Data Center, a local non-profit that provides data-based analysis on issues that matter most to government, business, nonprofit, and community leaders in the New Orleans region. Through the 2024-2025 school year, we will work with datasets relating to the city's trees and 311 reports to create a public hazard dashboard, analyzing risk and incorporating citizen input.
