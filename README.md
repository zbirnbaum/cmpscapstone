# cmpscapstone

This repository is for Zoe Birnbaum, Gabby Reese, Cece Haase, and Daniel Cicero's senior capstone project at Tulane. We are creating a data dashboard for The Data Center, which is a local non-profit that provides data-based analysis on issues that matter most to government, business, nonprofit, and community leaders in the New Orleans region. They have a plethora of data sets that can be analyzed to inform civic decision-making that we will be working with through the 2024-2025 school year.
